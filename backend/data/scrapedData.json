  "How Ozonetel CCaaS works",
  "Ozonetel CCaaS operates through Amazon Web Services (AWS) and connects to internally managed Points of Presence (POPs). These POPs interface with SIP trunks, either provided by Ozonetel or owned by the contact center. Different services come with different pricing; for more details, click here.",
  "When a caller/customer dials a contact center, this call will be connected to the telecom POPs which sends information to the CCaaS logic which is in AWS, and then routed to the respective contact center and the available agents. This process applies to both inbound and outbound calls. Below is the system's architecture diagram.",
